# syncedCameraRecorder
Grabs camera streams and compares timestamp for recording.

This library was developed because of the neccesity of perform synced video recording from different cameras, using USB off-the-shelf webcams in a parallel project: [Connected images](https://github.com/smorante/connected-images)

This library is intended for recording synced videos from different cameras. All cameras are accepted, even USB cheap ones!. This library may be very useful for developing stereo vision applications with non-expensive off-the-shelf cameras.
