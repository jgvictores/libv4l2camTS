## About
Grabs camera streams and compares timestamp for recording.

This library is intended for recording synced videos from different cameras. All cameras are accepted, even USB cheap ones!. This library may be very useful for developing stereo vision applications with non-expensive off-the-shelf cameras.

This library was developed because of the neccessity of performing synced video recording from different off-the-shelf USB webcams, in a parallel project: [Connected images](https://github.com/smorante/connected-images)
