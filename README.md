# syncedCameraRecorder

## About
Intended for recording synced videos from different cameras. Can be used for developing 3D stereo vision applications with low-cost USB webcams! The current implementation uses Video4Linux, and has been tested on Ubuntu 14.10 with a variety of low-cost off-the-shelf cameras.

This repository was born due to the need of obtaining synced video recordings from different off-the-shelf USB webcams, in a parallel project: [Connected images](https://github.com/smorante/connected-images)
